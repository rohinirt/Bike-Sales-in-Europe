## Objective
In a rapidly growing competitive market, understanding customer purchasing behavior and identifying high-performing products is critical for any retail business. This project aims to help a bike company gain actionable insights into sales performance, profitability, and customer segmentation by analyzing historical transaction data.
The goal is to support data-driven decision-making across sales, marketing, and inventory management by answering key questions like:
Which age group contributes the most to revenue?

Which product categories and bike models are driving profitability?

How do discounts affect profit margins?

What regions are most valuable in terms of sales?

## Dataset
Name: Bike Sales Data

Source: Kaggle

Data Cleaning: Performed in Microsoft Excel

Visualization Tool: Tableau

Tableau (Dashboard Design & Visualization)

## Key Analysis Performed
Sales trends by year (Order Quantity, Revenue, Profit, Discounts)

Revenue distribution by customer age groups

Global sales performance (United States, UK, Germany, etc.)

Product category and sub-category breakdown (Bikes, Accessories, Clothing)

Profitability analysis based on discounts and product types

Correlation between revenue, actual profit, and discount %

## Key Insights
Adults (35–64) are the top contributors to both order quantity and revenue.

Mountain Bikes generated the highest revenue among all bike series.

The United States and Australia are the most profitable regions.

Some clothing items, like jerseys, have low profit margins despite high discounts—suggesting room for pricing strategy optimization.

A positive linear relationship is observed between actual profit and expected profit across categories, but Clothing has significant deviation due to high discounts.
